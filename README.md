# Code Graph

## Development

If you cannot get the extension to compile automatically when you launch the debugger, run this command first: `npm run compile`

## TODO

1. Status bar button to open the graph, alongside a vscode command for it
1. Custom editor to display the graphs in
1. Backend for processing file data
